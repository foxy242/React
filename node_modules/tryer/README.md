## Say what?

Sometimes,
you want to defer
calling a function
until a certain
pre-requisite condition is met.
Other times,
you want to
call a function
repeatedly
until some post-requisite condition
is satisfied.
Occasionally,
you might even want
to do both
for the same function.

To save you writing
explicit conditions
and loops
on each of those occasions,
`tryer` implements
a predicate-based approach
that hides the cruft
behind a simple,
functional interface.

Additionally,
it allows you to easily specify
retry intervals
and limits,
so that your code
doesn't hog the CPU.
It also supports
exponential backoff
of retry intervals,
which can be useful
when handling
indefinite error states
such as network failure.
